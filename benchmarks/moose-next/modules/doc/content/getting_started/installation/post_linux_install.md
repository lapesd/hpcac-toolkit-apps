Once complete, the on-screen instructions will ask you to close any opened terminal windows. So, +in a new terminal window+, attempt to load the moose-dev-gcc module:

```bash
module load moose-dev-gcc
```

If no errors were generated running the above command, you have successfully installed moose-environment package. While optional, please read the next section about modifying your Bash Profile. +If you do not, you will have to perform the above `module load moose-dev-gcc` command each and every time you open a new terminal window before performing *any* MOOSE-based development.+
